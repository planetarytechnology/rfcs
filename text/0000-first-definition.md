Start the RFC process. Define the first text.

# Detailed design

The following list should provide a first proposal, to start the discussion to define the Planetary Technology Standard (PTS).
It contains multiple points, which should be discussed in separate RFC's.

### Decentralized infrastructure.
Reason: Failure resilience, Scalable, Independent.

### Go for zero/negative footprint
Reason: Improving, not harming the natural ecosystem.

### Sustainable resource generation/production
Reason: Reduce environmental impact.

### Reduce waste
Reason: Not to create waste.

### Recycling
Reason: Reduce environmental impact. Optimize resource regeneration.

### System optimization through data driven feedback
Reason: Continuous system optimization for collective benefit

### Modular Grid System
Reason: Make physical modules/components fit together, in a simple conform way.

# Drawbacks
